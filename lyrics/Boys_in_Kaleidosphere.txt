Hydrangeas are calling my name
Bring me to a garden I've never seen
There, I heard your sirens sing
Fill me with a feeling I've never known

Staring into my head
Your eyes are like kaleidoscope

After everyone leaves
You take the seat next to me quietly 
This pounding in my heart
Feels like kaleidoscope

Let's escape to somewhere we can be ourselves again
Where happily ever after is not only for queens and kings

Come here, we must leave
You hurried and took my hand
Jabberwocks opened up their mouths
Muttering words I don't understand

They bit and slashed you open
Cut off your legs, your arms, your head
This confusing sight
Feels like kaleidoscope

I held your head and ran for the edge
The edge of the world, down I go

If I was born in a different body, will our lives be easy?
If we get a next life I hope we're not human at all

Hydrangeas are calling my name
Bring me to a garden I've never seen
There, I saw your veiny wings
Filled me with a feeling so familiar

Cover me with your scales
Our love is like kaleidoscope
