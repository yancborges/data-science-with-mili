You whispered out my name
Woke me back up again
What are these things I see
Through the slots on my skin

Deeper
I'm sinking into the slot, the slot at my feet
Pulling me in
Colours
They make my vision insane
My vision is insane
I'm not the same
Red, blue, and green
They run down my veins, the veins in my brains
Dyeing me deep

You said that blue is life, and you said
You said that red is love
You said that red is love

It is only the first time we meet
But it feels like I've always been with you
A sense of deja vu
And you said that white is truth

Saturate
Vermillion
Cyan
Ebony
Burgundy
Silver machinery
Starring back at me

Why are my organs trying to escape this broken cage
Then I learned that this pounding can't be love
That it can't be love
That it can't be

Why are we always separated by bulletproof walls
Then I learned that this emptiness could be love
That it could be love
It must be love

You start to sing
So deadly and sweet

Magical spell
Turn heaven to hell
Light climbs up to my battery cell
Witchery evolves by trial
Aim for dream, I was your only shot
Despite so, again I failed

I've been waiting for this moment to come
The pink disappears and the black creeps upon
Tulalila
Always the same
Tulalila
Nothing will change

I've been waiting for this moment to come
The green disappears and the purple moves on
Tulalila
Always the same
Tulalila
Unless I change

All the life, ah all the life
Leaking out from the slots on my face
All the love, ah all the love
Leaking out from the slot on my wrist
All the truth, ah all the truth
Leaking out from the slot in my head
All the love, ah all the love
Leaking out from the slot on my chest
