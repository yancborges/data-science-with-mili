You've found a piece of me
Hidden behind the monitor beyond
Saw the worth in me I could never see
Polished my body
Let all my bitterness melt into candy
Poured me through your heat
Mold me to the shape I dream to be

Come here darling
Why don't you tell me what it is on your mind
Worry not darling
Point me to the sun
Solar power makes my circuit run

Mirror mirror
Just call my name
You are my queen
Commanding reflections of me
Clearer clearer
Convex concave
Zoom in or out
It's always a mystery
Mirror mirror
Focus my light
May the rest of your life be forever sunny
Fear fear
No more
The light will be by your side
Loving you silently

Tulitalula tuli tulitalulula
This is not just an optical illusion
Tulitalula tuli tulitalulula
Magnifying my love
Tulitalula tuli tulitalulula
Take me by the hand into your dimension
Tulitalula tuli tulitalulula
In your compound eyes

Come here darling
Why don't you tell me what it is on your mind
Worry not darling
Point me to the sun
Solar power turns my
Combat mode: ON

Mirror mirror
I'll spread my skin
Camouflaging you
With refractions of me
Fire fire
Point all my light
Thousands fahrenheit
Burn off your enemie
Medium rare
Trim off their fat
Slice off their flesh
Fancy feast consisting meat and meat and meat
Mirror mirror
The magic words wake me up
Embracing your everything
