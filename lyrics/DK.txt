I'm falling into your skin
Sinking deeper deeper ah
I'm drowning into your crystal eyes
Breathing no more, no more

I'm standing at the edge of reality
Will you miss me
If I take a leap

One tow three
Count with me
All the layers covering me
Dissolving me

Pick off your scabs
Embrace your naked self
Oh peel them off, peel them off, peel them off
Pick off your scabs
Embrace your naked self
Oh peel them off
Oh peel them off

I'm rotting inside my shell
I'm left behind
Left to decay
I'm rotting
I'm rotting, I'm rotting
I'm rotting, I'm rotting
I'm rotting, I'm rotting, I'm rotting
