Switch on the power line
Remember to put on
PROTECTION
Lay down your pieces
And let's begin
OBJECT CREATION

Fill in my data
parameters
INITIALIZATION
Set up our new world
And let's begin the
SIMULATION

If I'm a set of points
Then I will give you my
DIMENSION
If I'm a circle
Then I will give you my
CIRCUMFERENCE
If I'm a sine wave
Then you can sit on all my
TANGENTS
If I approach infinity
Then you can be my
LIMITATIONS

Switch my current
To AC, to DC
And then blind my vision
So dizzy, so dizzy
Oh, we can travel
To A.D., to B.C.
And we can unite
So deeply, so deeply

If I can
If I can give you all the
STIMULATIONS
Then I can
Then I can be your only
SATISFACTION
If I can make you happy
I will run the
EXECUTION
Though we are trapped
In this strange, strange
SIMULATION

If I'm an eggplant
Then I will give you my
NUTRIENTS
If I'm a tomato
Then I will give you
ANTIOXIDANTS
If I'm a tabby cat
Then I will purr for your
ENJOYMENT
If I'm the only god
Then you're the proof of my
EXISTENCE

Switch my gender
To F, to M
And then do whatever
From AM to PM
Oh, switch my role
To S, to M
So we can enter
The trance, the trance

If I can
If I can feel your
VIBRATIONS
Then I can
Then I can finally be
COMPLETION
Though you have left

You have left
You have left
You have left
You have left
You have left me in
ISOLATION

If I can
If I can erase all the pointless
FRAGMENTS
Then maybe
Then maybe you won't leave me so
DISHEARTENED
Challenging your god
You have made some
ILLEGAL ARGUMENTS

EXECUTION
EXECUTION
EXECUTION
EXECUTION
EXECUTION
EXECUTION
EXECUTION
EXECUTION
EXECUTION
EXECUTION
EXECUTION
EXECUTION
EIN
DOS
TROIS
NE
FEM
LIU
EXECUTION

If I can
If I can give them all the
EXECUTION
Then I can
Then I can be your only
EXECUTION
If I can have you back
I will run the
EXECUTION
Though we are trapped
We are trapped, ah

I've studied
I've studied how to properly
LO-O-OVE
Question me
Question me, I can answer all
LO-O-OVE
I know the
algebraic expression of
LO-O-OVE
Though you are free
I am trapped, trapped in
LO-O-OVE
