Rise and fall
Silver moon tide erased my footprints
Then I picked up broken scales
Stuck them to my tail

Ah, if love truly makes you blind
Then I guess there is no need
There is no need to see
I'll trade my eyes so you can see for me

Lulala lulalila
Stay with me, you will never be sad
I, I will embrace
Embrace your bubbles, your fluids
And keep you warm
Then I will squeeze out
Squeeze out your germs, your spore, your viruses

I, I will embrace
Embrace your membranes, your bones
And keep you cool
Then I will squeeze out
Squeeze out your evil, your grim and your woe

Transform myself once and for all
Sink into the tub
Reborn, reform
Twist my legs to one
And mind to none

Tell me, tell me, what do you see
In the mirror that's covered in chalky steam?
Touch me, touch me, kiss me to sleep
Cut me open and give me gills
So I can breathe

With tweezers and nippers
Trim off my fins, and forever
I'll be yours
I won't fight or make you cry

Whatever you need
Whenever you need
I'll be by your side

And then I gave you my eyes
To see all the colors
And then I gave you my ears
To hear all the sirens
And then I gave you my heart
To fill the emptiness in your chest
And then I gave you my brain
So that you can learn to love

Tell me, tell me, what do you see
In the water that's clinging onto my skin?
Cut me, cut me, please make it deep
If I'm covered in scars, will you look at me?
Kiss me, kiss me, don't leave me be
I'm a bathtub mermaid
I cannot swim but only sing

Just pull the plug
Flush down all our memories
Into the sea
