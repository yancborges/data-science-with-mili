Feathers
Stabbed by my own words
I can fly no more

All the mushrooms looked at me, looked at me
All the mushrooms surround me, surround me
All the mushrooms looked at me, looked at me
All the mushrooms surround me, surround me

I've walked across the witch's scalp
Pulled put her follicles
I'm a raging bird

Pecked off layers of their stems
Won't let them see my tears
Won't let them taste my fear

Automated decapitation
Won't let them see my tears
Won't let them taste my fear

Lula lila dulalila
Dalila lulila

And I thought that this is the triumph
That I needed to move on
I've blamed everything on you
It's easy to just pretend

You gently peeled open the wings covering my humiliated face
I was so ashamed

The mushrooms spoke
I've sat here all my life feeling sorry for myself
And they spoke
Trampled, used, and dumped
Got no pride to push them down
Finding peace in her suffering
As I go up a place in the hierarchy
Since when have I, have I became me?

I gave up crying
I gave up waiting
I gave up dreaming optimistic dreams

Ripped out my feathers
Cracked up my beak
Freed my screams

Your spores cling onto my skin
Powdery snow cleared up my sins

Through my pores
Tiny fibers sprout out
Grow into stems and caps

All the mushrooms looked at me, looked at me
All the mushrooms surround me, surround me

Mushroom mushroom-shroom
Mushroom mushroom mushroom-shrooma
Mushroom mu-mushroom-shrooma
Lalalalala ah
Mushroom mushroom-shroom
Mushroom mushroom mushroom-shrooma
Mushroom mu-mushroom-shrooma
Lalalalala
