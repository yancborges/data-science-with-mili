Calla lily, carnation, daisy
Silently chase away your worries
Chrysanthemum, kalanchoe
Become your shield whenever you fall asleep

I cried out
Please don't leave me behind, leave me behind
So you held me tight
And said I will be just fine, I will be just fine, I will be just fine

Petals dance for our valediction
And synchronize to your frozen pulsation
Take me to where your soul may live in peace
Final destination
Touch of your skin sympathetically brushed against
The shoulders you used to embrace
Sparkling ashes drift along your flames
And softly merge into the sky

Lisianthus
Aroma drags me out of where I was
Cream rose, stargazer, iris
Construct the map that helps me trace your steps

Zipped my mouth
I just keep climbing up, keep climbing up
Justify our vows
I know you are right above, you are right above, you are right above

Look now
I'm on the top of your world, top of your world
My darling
Here I come, I yell
And take a leap to Hell

Swirling wind sings for our reunion
And nine point eight is my acceleration
Take me to where our souls may live in peace
Our brand new commencement
Touch of your lips compassionately pressed against
The skull that you used to cherish
Delicate flesh decomposes off my rotten bones
And softly merge into the sky
