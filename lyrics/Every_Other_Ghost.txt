Like summer nights passing by, passing by
Blow away moments I regret

Like the wind you came passing by, passing by
Stir up an endless storm

Like winter nights passing by, passing by
Under my blankets I chase after you

Like the wind you came passing by, passing by
Ghosts you have left behind

Every meter of my skin reaching out
Like every other ghost here to prove my love

Every meter of my skin
Like every other ghost refusing to be dead

Lalala-la
La-la-lala
