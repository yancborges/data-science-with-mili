Hop, hop, you came along
my secret laboratory
Spiky, spiky bloody fangs
hungry for my qi

Hold up, mister! Right there, mister!
Sit down, mister, how about some retort
pouch of curry, pouch of chili,
pouch of MRE, but you're rather picky

Well, I'll make you something else
Don't need to show me how
since I'm the mad scientist, proclaimed by myself
Canto or sichuan
Jiansu or hunan
No matter which one you pick, I'll get it done

Zhajiangmian and xioalongbao
Wonton and chashao
Delivery or takeout won't beat my retort pouch
You're loving my retort
I'm loving your retort
You're my only retort, you're my only retort

一一
一二一
一二三四五六七

(Yi, yi
Yi er yi
Yi er san si wu liu qi)

一一

一二三四五六七

(Yi, yi
Yi er yi
Yi er san si wu liu qi)

Crack, crack, you stretch your arms out
asking for a hug
Hidden under your talisman
is your practiced smile

Come here, mister! Help me, mister!
Right here, mister, you took up my spoon
Stirring curry, stirring chili
That's when I've realized we've became family

Then he came, a man in black and white
He's holding laser guns and Bagua signs
Then he aimed at your slimy skin
and pulled the trigger
Your head bursts

Shh, I'll stitch you back up
Don't need to show me how
Since I'm the mad scientist, proclaimed by myself
I'll give you plastic eyes
and give you nylon hair
and I'll make sure I get your talisman repaired

Shark fin soup or dim sum
Dumpling or Peking duck
Nothing I make is gonna bring that charm inside you back
But you're still my retort
But you're still my retort
I'm seeking for retort, I'm seeking for retort
