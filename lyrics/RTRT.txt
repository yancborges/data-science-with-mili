[Miracle milk]
Hop hop
You came along my secret labotory
Spiky spiky bloody fangs hungry for my Qi(气)
Hold up, mister
Right there, mister
Sit down, mister
How about some retort pouch of curry
Pouch of chili
Pouch of MRE
But you're rather picky
Well I'll make you something else
Don't need to show me how
Since I'm the mad scientist, proclaimed by myself
Canto(广东) or Sichuan(四川)
Jiangsu(江苏) or Hunan(湖南)
No matter which one you pick I'll get it done
Zhajiangmian(炸酱面) and Xiaolongbao(小笼包)
Wonton(馄饨) and Chashao(叉烧)
Delivery or takeout won't beat my retort pouch
You're loving my retort
I'm loving your retort
You're my only retort
You're my only retort
【一 一 ・ 一 二 一 ・ 一 二 三 四 五 六 七】
Crack crack
You stretch your arms out asking for a hug
Hidden under your talisman is your practiced smile
Come here, mister
Help me, mister
Right here, mister
You took up my spoon
Stirring curry
Stirring chili
That's when I've realized
We've became family
Then he came
A man in black and white
He's holding laser guns and Bagua(八卦) signs
Then he aimed at your slimey skin
And pulled the trigger
Your head bursts
Shh
I'll stitch you back up
Don't need to show me how
Since I'm the mad scientist, proclaimed by myself
I'll give you plastic eyes
And give you nylon hair
And I'll make sure I get your talisman repaired
Shark fin soup or Dim sum(点心)
Dumpling or Peking(北京) duck
Nothing I make is gonna bring that charm inside you back
But you're still my RTRT
But you're still my RTRT
I'm seeking for RTRT
I'm seeking for RTRT
