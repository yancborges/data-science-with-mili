Ah, you strike me like I've never felt before
For you, I can go through Naraka and more

Hummus and tofu burgers
In the shape of my ever-beating heart
Vanilla rice pudding laced
With aphrodisiac liquor

You sit tall and straight not making a sound
Chanting the heavens' song
Bring me along

Though you look through me
Like I wasn't there
Soaked myself in cold water
Breaking this endless wheel
Praying for divine powers
So we can become one

Darling, I'm sure next life you'll love me, too
Next life you'll love me, too
Next life you'll love me, too

So I guess till then
I'll do with veggie steaks

Lost in Zen
You're a lotus flower
No need for Shoalin Quan
I will be your power

Ocean of fire or mountain of blades
Doesn't matter at all

I'll burn down all these worlds
If that's what it takes to realize our love
No god can make me stop

Oh, I know it won't change a thing
I have no place in your mind
It's filled with nothingness
And that's why I love you

And I know that next life you'll love me, too
Next life you'll love me, too
Next life you'll love me, too
Next life you'll love me, too
Next life you'll love me, too
