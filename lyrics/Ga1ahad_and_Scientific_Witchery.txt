(Witch)
The magical potion of reanimation
(Ga1ahad)
Bittersweet cranberry flavored euphoria
(Witch)
Rise from bed, my darling
(Both)
So I can see you again!
So I can kill you again!

(Ga1ahad)
My brains accelerate
(Witch)
And I'll
(Both)
Reassemble you again

(Ga1ahad)
The witches can't be loved
So bravely I fought
They fell and failed
My Lady doesn't wilt

(Witch)
Lata lulila lulula lulila ta
Lata lulila lulula lulalila
Lata lulila lulula lulila ta
Lata lulila lulula lulalila

(Witch)
Poisoned sandwich tea party starts now!
Eat up, if you're lucky you won't rot
(Ga1ahad)
Eat up, it's your turn, eat till you drop
(Witch)
Eat up, maybe this time you'll be caught
(Ga1ahad)
Eat up, fill your stomach till it pops
(Both)
Eat up, eat it all, just eat it all
'Cause there's no poison after all

(Ga1ahad)
I've cleared mountains and dungeons
Iron maiden, my Lady has spoken,
"Ga1ahad, you shall never collapse,"
So I charged up my lasers

(Witch)
Talila lulila;
That makes your bones stronger than steel
Tulila talila;
That backs up your thoughts to the cloud

(Witch)
Truth or false, it's the logic that dictates it all
Rising edge ticks the clock
Stimulates your flip flop
Generate, oscillate, let your blood fill the gates
Multiplex, process registration

(Witch)
Wipe off your pus, grind down your vitamins
The end justifies the means
Open the book, turn to page six-seventeen
Scientific Witchery!

(Ga1ahad)
Someday I'll conquer the land and have you slayed
(Witch)
Blast away, blast away,
Don't be like Lance10t, you are the new upgrade
(Ga1ahad)
I appreciate your thoughts,
But you've given me too much to tolerate
(Witch)
I've done so much for you, but you treat me this way?

(Both)
No forgiveness for this endless love
My goddess never looked at me

(Ga1ahad)
Finally our wounds closed
(Witch)
Our wounds closed
(Ga1ahad)
Turned into
(Both)
Purple scabs

(Both)
Kiss me,
Tenderly
Gently
Violently

(Witch)
There's no undo
And there's no repeat
(Ga1ahad)
Can't go back to
How we used to be
(Both)
There's no restart,
But only proceed
Take up from where
We've left off and see
