Is this where I belong?
The furthest I could have gone

Sprout, sprout, little peas
You will be so tall and strong, fight on
Bloom, bloom, little fires
Light up our darkening path, make it last

Let the maggots sing a tiny little song
Tiniest voices sang all night long
Let the maggots dream, no matter right or wrong
Let us dream on, dream on, dream on and on

Ta lulali talula, tulali talula
Silence dances into their tiny mouths
Talali talula, tulali talula
Taking their steps, strangling them all

Then the soup became a pair of wings
With such beautiful veins
How much I wish to be

Let the maggots sing a tiny little song
Tiniest voices sang all night long
Let the maggots dream, no matter right or wrong
Let us dream on, dream on, ah

Let the maggots sing, no audience to be found
Muted voices sang all life long
Let the maggots dream, no matter right or wrong
Let us dream on, dream on, dream on and on

Is this where I belong?
The furthest I could have gone
