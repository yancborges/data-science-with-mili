Lively, lively
My little angel
Follow me, follow me
We'll have great discoveries
Find a future
Find a land of dreams
Find a heaven
Find a home that won't leave you
No matter how long you've been lost
Pursuit, pursuit
Don't ever give in

Rosetta
For everyone everywhere everything will betray your innocent heart
All of them
All of them
Soon will be rotten
Vile, vile
Shield yourself
Mind my words
Don't let yourself corrupt

Run, Run
Darling
Search, search
Don't look back
It's not where you belong to

Everything to us
Just you and I
Lalala
Just you and I
Not a thing for us
Just you and I
Tululu
Just you and I

Lonely, lonely
Come back to me
Rosetta
No-one nowhere nothing will take anything anything anything from me
Nobody nobody nobody ever
Nobody nobody nobody other than you
