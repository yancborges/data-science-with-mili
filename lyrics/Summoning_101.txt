I peek through the gate
Found your hiding place
Feather pens scribble down your commands
Scientific evocation

Decomposing wolf fangs
Powdery moonlight, half a human

Bite off your nail
Paint a magic circle
Chanting the magic spell

Summon me now

Take my paws, take my paws
Show me wonders of your world
The autumn leaves, the summer breeze
Your shiny hair like mahogony

Teach me, oh, teach me
The language that you sing
Lyrr viva tou conquieta
Aeterrno amora

Crumbling gate
Take me back to empty space
Reached out to your gentle hands
Doors closed, clipped my arm right off

Still, you will never give up
Scanning nether for my whereabouts

Ahoooooo
Summon me now

Years gone by, no moments wasted
Day and night, no memories faded
Six hundred and seventeen pages
Now've became the basis of all creations

Hold on tight, hold on tight
Let me shield you from the storm
The melting flesh, the burning tears
Make you stronger than ever before

Vive torr amora vrk
The last words that you spoke
Oozing out from your tiny skull
Thousand years' wisdom

Take my paw, take my paw
You're the wonder of my world
The wrinkled face, the silver hair
Your crystal eyes stay a beautiful pair

Teach me, oh, teach me
The magic that you preach
I tried to speak, but all that came out was
Ah-ooh-a-ooh-a-ooh

Lyrr viva tou conquieta
Aeterrno amora
