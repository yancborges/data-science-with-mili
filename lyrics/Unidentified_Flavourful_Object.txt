Melting caramel drizzled over my baked custard pudding 
Softly embraces my taste buds 
Deliciously 
Maple syrup covered recipe 
 
Lulala lilulila 
Curled up under my blanket 
Lulala lilulila 
Made out of fluffy omelette 
So many flavours to explore 
I have to eat more 
 
Candied ginger slices in between your rosy lips 
One kiss is not enough for my sweet sweet tooth 
 
Your eyes flicker like marbled champagne 
With pomegranate tea and dreams 
A little bit spice 
A little bit salt 
A little bit sugar to top it all 
Rosemary cardamom anise 
The flavours you taught me puts me at ease 
Love melts in my mouth 
Dissolves my doubt 
Paprika and parsley 
Dance with me now 
No matter how far you go 
I'll always let you know
 
Kristi vechuna es tilia
Hon deli e kasum ciella
Lihie hanx ne tellehe 
Ccuccu ni ha quatrolle he
 
That every moment I've spent with you is an everlasting view 
I'll shape my thoughts into little cubes 
And dip them in chocolate fondue 
Across the sea and the land and the breeze 
I bet that you're feeling lonely 
You must be hungry waiting for me 
 
Me 
With you And me 
Together 
Have faith in me 
Engine powered by bitter memories 
Penetrate time and space 
I'm flying across milky way 
So don't be late
