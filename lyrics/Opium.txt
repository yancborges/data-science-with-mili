I just wanted to tug your hair behind your ears
Hold you in my arms
I'm always here

I couldn't have gone so far, so far
Without your absence
But somehow I still wish
That you'll be here

You're my poison
You're my poison
You're my poison
Magical scent
I'm addicted to
I'm addicted to
I'm addicted to you

I just wanted to let you know I'm sorry too
Neither of us wanted it to end up this way

The poppies cry
The poppies sing
The poppies bleed
As we drifted apart
Have me poisoned
You have me poisoned
Oh talk to me
Tell me the world you see
I just wanted to make you smile again
