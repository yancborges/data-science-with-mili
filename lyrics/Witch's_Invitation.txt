When you lied, I lied
Things could have turned out right
You died, survived
The Witch's reconstruction
Improvement
Extension
Progressive evolution
Until your semi-completion
Lovely diversion

Thousand pixies fly
Dancing in the golden sky

Rise from bed
For the ones who sacrificed
The ones who never cried
The ones who haven't died
The ones who are alive
Tonight

Tuleetaleetalulah

Set me free
Yesterday's already history
Paint your own future story trees
When will I be able to walk out misery
Plastic eyes that let you see
Until the day we finally meet
Logic, theory, philosophy
For humanity

Listen to the chanting of the rain
Embrace the petrified river's pain
Take a walk around the edge of ocean's vein
Soak up all the warmth at your domain

夢に見た世界は　くるくると廻り続け The world seen in a dream continues around and round and round
ぽろぽろと剥がれた　君の腕を抱きしめながら A flake peeled off while hugging your arm

Pop and plop and flop and toss
Hop and drop and slop and waltz

夢に見た世界は　がらがらと音を立てて
ころころと転がる　君のひとみを拾い上げて

Purple-black tea
Spilled on your memories
Poison cookies
For the Witch's enemy
Humbly gradually frivolously thoughtlessly
For you
Butter pancakes coated with candied blueberries
Mango yogurt sprinkled with marshmallow jelly

Not until death do us part
Forbidden plastic heart supported you far
Not until death do us part
Followed another restart
Restart
