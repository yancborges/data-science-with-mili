Remember to put on silencer
Exactly like our mother's words
We forget about spilled wine
But the stain will not be gone

Though the violence is familiar
And the touch of their fingers bitter and sweet
The flavors are not yours to seize
Don't ever give in, please
Camelia

I was the one to venture
Settling only for more
I've poured out my everything
My everything inside

With grown-up eyes, you'll see
Some men are pigs, some girls are the same
Why would their lies stop tonight?

Remember to put on silencer
Exactly like our mother's words
We forget about spilled wine
But the stain will not be gone

Though the violence is familiar
And the touch of their fingers bitter and sweet
The flavors are not yours to seize
Stay lively and free

Nobody is born a fighter
There isn't enough space for all of us
You don't have to act so tough
But your focus shall never budge

Everyone is really similar
Strip them down to the core, the flesh and skin
See how their love is thin
Don't you ever give in
Camelia

I pulled the trigger, bang bang
Though unlike in the movies, so loud it screamed
We forget about killed swine
But the pain will not be gone

Echoing down the corridor
The soul of a naked man looking for more
Looks like you still stand
Let me finish you, bang bang bang

Remember to put on silencer
Exactly like our mother's words
We forget about spilled wine
But the stain will not be gone

Though the violence is familiar
And the touch of their fingers bitter and sweet
The flavors are not yours to seize
Stay lively and free

Nobody is born a fighter
There isn't enough space for all of us
You don't have to act so tough
No one can make you budge

Nothing of him was particular
Though somehow I was obedient till now
See how their blood is vile
Don't let yourself corrupt
Camelia
