Side by side, the lovelier goes up
Reach for the top, till the bubble pops
Take a memory, insert to the past
Which one is the sweetest? Save it before the last

If you turn into a table
You must be have good height of my elbows
A stubby leg makes you ugly
You're the only perfect table for me
If you turn into an eggplant
You'll be my purple friend
Scratching out marks on your body
You're the only perfect eggplant for me
I'm searching

If you're a cat
A little kitten
You must be bluepoint
Meowing a lot
Hissing a lot
But you never purr
If you're a steak
A fillet mignon covered in mushroom sauce
Browned on the outside
Medium rare inside

If you turn into a flower
You must be the most delicate ever
Even if you bloom just occasionally
You're the only perfect flower for me
If you turn into a human
I like hog the warmth come from your hands
Bitter stinky breath with hair that is oily
You're the only perfect human for me
I'm searching

If you're a piece
A piece of shit
You must be... U-Um?
What? What's it called?
What's ever again?
N-O-O-O
If you could stay
Stay there where you are
So I can... U-Um?
Oh, what? What's it called?
What's ever again?
L-O-V-E?

I'm searching for
Searching for you everywhere
I can see you in most everything
I'm searching for
Searching for you everywhere
But somehow you can stop transforming
I'm searching for, searching for, searching for
Searching for, searching for, searching for
A-Ah
I'm searching for, searching for, searching for
Myself that has gone since you have left

Each one of us has a bucket of love
Some of us empty, some of us filled up
Cut this into pieces, break us down to the cell
Merge us back up, we have evolved now

If you turn into a flower
You must be the most delicate ever
Even if you bloom just occasionally
You're the only perfect flower for me
If you turn into a human
I like hog the warmth come from your hands
Bitter stinky breath with hair that is oily
You're the only perfect human for me
I'm searching

If you're a dog
A little puppy
Going ruff ruff ruff
If you're a fruit
A tomato
Full of juice?
