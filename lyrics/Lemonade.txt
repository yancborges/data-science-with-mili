Sparkling leftover lemonade you'll never touch
Tripped over my knock-off iittala cup

Lemonade
It spills all over, over and over
Over, over and over
Over, no matter how much I clean it up
Over, over and over
Over, over and over
Over, lemonade sinks into the floor
Over, over and over
Over, over and over
Over, no matter how much I lick it off
Over, over and over
Over, over and over
Over and over and over and over

You said I make the best lemonade in the world
A little bitter, a little sweet, a little sour
Now that you're gone, so much lemonade gets left over
Waiting to be drank
I wish that person could be you

Lemonade
It spills all over, over and over
Over, over and over
Over, no matter how much I want you back
Over, over and over
Over, over and over
Over, lemonade stains my pillowcase
Over, over and over
Over, over and over
Over, no matter how much I wipe it off
Over, over and over
Over, over and over
Over and over and over and over

Over
And over
Over and over
And over
And over

Sparkling leftover lemonade you'll never touch
Tripped over my knock-off iittala cup

Lemonade
It spills all over
And over
All over
And over
