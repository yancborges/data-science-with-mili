Pick up a straw, wash down all your filth
Take a sip of my heavenly milk
Cleanse up your body, cleanse up your soul
All you need is Twin Island's Milk!

Perfect life for you and I
People who's trying to get by
Painful death for the lactose intolerant
For you there is no lament!

Bad chromosomes or sad broken toes
Cure it up with my heavenly milk
Sold your properties to the devil
All you need is Twin Island's Milk!

Lovely life for you and I
People who's fighting 'til midnight
Painful death for the lactose intolerant
Begin the revolution!

La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la, la la la
La, la la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la, la la la

Plotting against the government and your foes
Build your bones with my heavenly milk
Wanna be princess but you're a toad
All you need is Twin Island's Milk!

Endless life for you and I
People who stick to each other's sides
Painful death for the lactose intolerant
Struggle 'til your last moment!
