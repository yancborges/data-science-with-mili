If you think we take too much
Then you can sacrifice yourself
Don't push your values, push your values
Onto the crowd

The world runs on its kings
Its slaves, leaving some with more choice
The hypocrites, they justify
Their very sense of justice

I tell myself
I'm not like everyone else
Believing without doubt

Mix it in
My vitamins
Oh, mix it in
Ah

If you think we eat too much
Then you can sacrifice yourself
Don't mix your garbage, mix your garbage
Into my cup

So many resources keep me alive
Yet I don't even step outside
So many sacrifices keep me alive
Yet I don't even bother to survive

Once and for all, blend up my thoughts
Into slush, into slush
Once and for all, return my cells
Into slush, into slush

If you think we waste too much
Then you can sacrifice yourself
Don't push your values, push your values
Onto the crowd

Mix it in
My vitamins
Oh, mix it in

The world runs on its kings
Its slaves, leaving some with more choice
The hypocrites, they justify
Their very sense of justice

I tell myself
I'm not like everyone else
Believing without doubt

Mix it in
My vitamins
Oh, mix it in
Ah

If you think we live too much
Then you can sacrifice yourself
Don't mix your garbage, mix your garbage
Into my cup

So many resources keep me alive
Yet I don't even step outside
So many sacrifices keep me alive
So many sacrifices keep me alive
So many sacrifices keep me alive
Yet I don't even bother to survive

Once and for all, blend up my thoughts
Into slush, into slush
Once and for all, return my cells
Into slush, into slush

Once and for all, return my cells
Into slush, into slush
